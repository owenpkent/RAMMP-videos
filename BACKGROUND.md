# RAMMP Initiative - Background

## Overview

The **Robotic Assistive Mobility and Manipulation Platform (RAMMP)** is a $41 million ARPA-H funded program led by the University of Pittsburgh to create the next generation of open-source robotic assistive mobility and manipulation technologies.

## The Mission

RAMMP aims to empower people with disabilities to live more independently by combining:
- Advanced robotics
- Artificial intelligence
- Digital twin simulation

The program is designed to enable greater autonomy and reduce reliance on caregivers, helping users perform daily tasks safely and independently.

## Key Players

### Lead Institution
**University of Pittsburgh**  
**Principal Investigator:** Rory Cooper, Ph.D.

### Primary Contractor
**Assistive Technology Development, Inc. (ATDev)**
- Founded in 2020, spun out of UC Berkeley
- Mission: Independent mobility for all
- Role: Leading architectural design, OS development, simulation platform, and hardware assets

### Consortium Partners
- Carnegie Mellon University
- Cornell University
- Northeastern University
- Purdue University
- Kinova Robotics
- LUCI Mobility

## ATDev's Role

ATDev is leading critical components of the RAMMP initiative:

- **Operating System & Simulation Platform:** Developing a new OS and simulation platform optimized for assistive technology
- **Hardware Assets:** Creating key platform technologies for next-generation medical robotics
- **System Integration:** Integrating adaptive AI controls, advanced sensor fusion, and assistive user interfaces
- **Focus Areas:** Semi-autonomous navigation and manipulation for daily task support

### ATDev Leadership

- **Todd Roberts** - CEO and Co-Founder
- **Owen Kent** - Chief Marketing Officer and Co-Founder
- **William Emfinger, Ph.D.** - Principal Investigator and Chief Technology Officer
  - Formerly CTO at Max Mobility (wheelchair propulsion company)
  - Former Director of R&D at Permobil (global wheelchair manufacturer)

## The Vision

Building the next generation of robotic wheelchairs that:
- Support semi-autonomous navigation and manipulation
- Integrate cutting-edge AI and robotics research
- Prioritize accessibility and human-centered design
- Enable people with disabilities to move freely and live with dignity

## Research Foundation

RAMMP builds on decades of groundbreaking research at the University of Pittsburgh's **Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL)**, one of the world's leading centers for rehabilitation and assistive robotics.

## Funding

This research is funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
