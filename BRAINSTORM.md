# RAMMP Videos - Brainstorming Stats & Ideas

## Why We Need Robotic Wheelchairs

### Key Statistics

- By 2030, **1 in 6 people** will be over 60
- Of those over 60, **1 in 4** will need mobility assistance
- **$41 million** ARPA-H investment in RAMMP program
- **Millions of Americans** could benefit from robotic mobility independence

### Core Talking Points

- National commitment to transforming independence through robotics
- Reducing reliance on caregivers = cost savings + dignity
- Open-source platform = accessible, scalable solutions
- Bridging cutting-edge research with real-world assistive devices
- Semi-autonomous navigation for daily tasks (safety + independence)
- AI + robotics + digital twin simulation = next-gen mobility
- Building on decades of research at HERL (University of Pittsburgh)

## Day-in-the-Life Documentary Videos

### Purpose
Capture authentic experiences of wheelchair users and elderly individuals to showcase:
- Current challenges and limitations with existing mobility technology
- Daily obstacles that reduce independence
- Reliance on caregivers for basic tasks
- Emotional and practical impact of mobility limitations
- Contrast between current reality and RAMMP's potential future

### Video Concepts

#### Current Reality Series
- **Morning Routine** — Getting out of bed, bathroom, getting dressed (caregiver dependence)
- **Around the Home** — Navigation challenges, reaching items, kitchen tasks
- **Going Out** — Transportation barriers, accessibility issues, public spaces
- **Work/Social Life** — Participation limitations, isolation factors
- **Evening Routine** — Meal prep, personal care, getting into bed

#### Technology Gaps Series
- **Manual Wheelchair Limitations** — Physical strain, limited range, fatigue
- **Power Wheelchair Challenges** — Navigation in tight spaces, manipulation tasks
- **Walker/Cane Users** — Fall risks, limited mobility range, exhaustion
- **Current Assistive Tech** — What exists today and where it falls short

#### Elderly Focus
- **Aging in Place** — Home modifications needed, daily struggles
- **Loss of Independence** — Transitioning from independent to needing help
- **Caregiver Burden** — Impact on family members and professional caregivers
- **Social Isolation** — How mobility limitations reduce social engagement

#### Comparative Format
- **Before RAMMP** — Current state with existing technology
- **With RAMMP** — Envisioned future with robotic assistance
- **Side-by-Side** — Direct comparison of same tasks with/without RAMMP tech

### Production Approach
- Follow real users over multiple days
- Capture both successes and frustrations
- Include interviews with users, family members, and caregivers
- Document specific pain points and unmet needs
- Show emotional moments (struggles, small victories, frustrations)
- Respect dignity while being honest about challenges
- Get consent and build trust with participants

### Key Questions to Address
- What tasks require caregiver assistance?
- What activities do you avoid because of mobility limitations?
- How has your independence changed over time?
- What would you do differently if you had better mobility technology?
- How does limited mobility affect your mental health and social life?

## Coffee Task Demo Video

### Purpose
Demonstrate the complexity of a simple task (getting coffee) and how RAMMP technology improves the experience. This will showcase the step-by-step challenges wheelchair users face and the platform's ability to provide assistance.

### Steps for Coffee Task Demo

**Current Process (Manual Wheelchair):**
1. Start in exp lab
2. Move to door
3. Find & press door open
4. Pass through door 1
5. Move to door 2
6. Repeat steps 3-4
7. Navigate sidewalks
   - Today: Find curb cuts
   - 6-mo: Go "straight"
8. Navigate Starbucks door (No ADA opener)
9. Navigate to counter
10. Order coffee
11. Pay (Apple Wallet on Starbucks app, Google Pay, etc.)
12. Pick-up (coffee, etc.)
   - Hand-over
13. Navigate to park
   - No-spill during curb climbing
14. Approach & dock w/ table
15. Drink coffee

**Future Enhancements:**
- Navigate cluttered environments
- Get official support from Starbucks (Owen to make visual representation)

### Evaluation Metrics

**Primary Metrics:**
1. **Time to complete task**
2. **Total distance traveled**
3. **# of times user makes an input**
4. **# of corrections**
5. **How many times does user need caregiver intervention?**
6. **Reduction in training time?**
7. **Seat Stability (IMU)** - user comfort (survey)

**Success Criteria:**
8. **Task Load Index** (cognitive load) - NASA uses this
9. **Is task accomplished?** (% have this)

**Comparison Benchmarks:**
- **State of Art Today:**
  - Standard wheelchair
  - Wheelchair + Vaco 2
  - 0% independence + LUCI
  - 10% independence?

- **ARPA-H Goals:**
  - Integrated Robotic Platform will be standard of care
  - 100% independence (5-year)
  - 50% independence (6-month)
  - *As measured by metric 5
  - *TBD
