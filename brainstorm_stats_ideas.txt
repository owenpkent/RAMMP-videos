ROBOTIC WHEELCHAIRS - BRAINSTORMING STATS & IDEAS
===================================================

WHY WE NEED ROBOTIC WHEELCHAIRS
--------------------------------

Key Statistics:
- By 2030, 1 in 6 people will be over 60
- Of those over 60, 1 in 4 will need mobility assistance
- $41 million ARPA-H investment in RAMMP program
- Millions of Americans could benefit from robotic mobility independence

Ideas & Talking Points:
- National commitment to transforming independence through robotics
- Reducing reliance on caregivers = cost savings + dignity
- Open-source platform = accessible, scalable solutions
- Bridging cutting-edge research with real-world assistive devices
- Semi-autonomous navigation for daily tasks (safety + independence)
- AI + robotics + digital twin simulation = next-gen mobility
- Building on decades of research at HERL (University of Pittsburgh)

VIDEO IDEAS FOR CONGRESS & FUNDERS
===================================

SHORT VIDEOS (30-60 seconds):
------------------------------
1. **The Aging Crisis** - Quick stat visualization showing demographic shift by 2030
   - Hook: "1 in 6 people over 60. 1 in 4 need mobility help. Are we ready?"
   
2. **What is RAMMP?** - Fast explainer of the program
   - $41M investment, open-source robotics, independence for millions
   
3. **The Independence Gap** - Show daily tasks that require caregiver assistance
   - Emotional hook: what independence means
   
4. **ROI for America** - Economic case (reduced caregiver costs, workforce participation)
   
5. **Technology Showcase** - Quick demo of AI navigation, manipulation capabilities

MEDIUM VIDEOS (2-3 minutes):
----------------------------
6. **The Human Story** - Profile of someone who needs mobility assistance
   - Their daily challenges, how RAMMP could transform their life
   
7. **The Science Behind RAMMP** - Explain the tech (AI, sensor fusion, digital twins)
   - Make it accessible but impressive
   
8. **The Consortium** - Showcase the powerhouse team (Pitt, CMU, Cornell, etc.)
   - Why this collaboration matters
   
9. **From Lab to Life** - ATDev's role in commercialization
   - How research becomes real products people can use
   
10. **Open Source = Access** - Why making this open-source matters
    - Democratizing advanced assistive technology

LONGER VIDEOS (5-7 minutes):
----------------------------
11. **The Full Vision** - Comprehensive overview of RAMMP
    - Problem → Solution → Impact → Timeline
    
12. **Expert Panel** - Interviews with Dr. Rory Cooper, ATDev leadership, users
    - Multi-perspective case for investment
    
13. **Day in the Life: Before & After** - Contrast current limitations vs. RAMMP future
    - Emotional + practical case
    
14. **National Security of Health** - Frame as infrastructure investment
    - Aging population, healthcare costs, American innovation leadership

SPECIAL PURPOSE VIDEOS:
-----------------------
15. **Elevator Pitch** (15 seconds) - For social media, quick shares
    
16. **Testimonial Series** - Short clips from potential users, caregivers, researchers
    
17. **B-roll Package** - Lab footage, wheelchair demos, AI visualization
    - For media/press use
    
18. **Congressional Hearing Opener** (2 min) - Designed to open testimony
    - Powerful, factual, emotional hook

KEY MESSAGING THEMES:
--------------------
- Independence = Dignity
- Innovation = American Leadership
- Investment = Returns (economic + social)
- Open Source = Accessibility at Scale
- Urgency = Demographic Reality
- Collaboration = World-Class Consortium
- Proven Track Record = HERL's decades of research

TARGET AUDIENCES:
----------------
- Congressional committees (health, aging, innovation, appropriations)
- ARPA-H leadership and reviewers
- NIH and other federal health agencies
- State legislators and governors
- Private foundations (disability rights, aging, health innovation)
- Healthcare systems and insurers
- Disability advocacy organizations

PRODUCTION NOTES:
----------------
- Mix emotional storytelling with hard data
- Show real people, real challenges, real solutions
- Use high-quality visuals of technology (not just talking heads)
- Keep technical explanations accessible
- Always tie back to human impact
- Include clear calls to action (funding, support, partnership)
